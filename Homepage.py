    This website breaks down the striking parallels between social media manipulation and the many cult tactics 
    we have discussed in our rhetoric and ideology class. These platforms use reward/punishment systems, language 
    manipulation, and identity shaping to influence users—especially younger generations. Algorithmic rewards like likes
    and shares create a constant need for validation, while punishments like less engagement enforce conformity. At the same 
    time, jargon and trending language foster in-group loyalty and exclusion, mirroring cult-like behaviors.

    But why do these platforms employ such strategies? The answer lies in economics.  By encouraging frequent engagement, 
    platforms boost ad revenue and ensure they remain an essential part of users' daily lives.

    Through this site, you’ll learn how these tactics work, their psychological effects, and why it matters. Dive into the tabs to 
    explore the reward/punishment dynamic, language manipulation, and identity-shaping tactics used by social media platforms that 
    shape how we think, act, and even see ourselves online. Let’s uncover the truth behind the scroll.
