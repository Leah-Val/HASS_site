st.title("Rewards and Punishments in Social Media")

st.markdown("""
Social media platforms are often structured around a feedback loop of rewards and punishments that mirrors cult conditioning techniques. 
In cult environments, rewards such as approval, access, and recognition are used to reinforce loyalty, while punishments like exclusion, 
shaming, or loss of privileges maintain control. Social media platforms, particularly those like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, employ 
analogous mechanisms to shape user behavior and maximize engagement.

st.markdown("""
The concept of operant conditioning, explored in Jiaxuan Wang and Xunpei Zhang’s research paper *The Reinforcements and Punishments in Social Media Addiction*, 
highlights how positive reinforcements like "likes," shares, and favorable comments encourage continued engagement. Each instance of validation provides a sense of gratification, 
much like traditional rewards such as food or money (Wang and Zhang 1460). This mechanism mirrors how charismatic cult leaders reward conformity with praise and inclusion.

Furthermore, we can relate these rewards to Chapter 6 of Alexandra Stein’s *Terror, Love, and Brainwashing*. Stein explains that charismatic leaders use the promise of love 
or safety to draw followers in. Similarly, social media platforms employ positive reinforcement such as likes, shares, and comments. These rewards provide a sense of belonging 
and accomplishment, which Stein identifies as part of the "love" element of control (Stein 110). Users experience feelings of being valued and included, creating an emotional 
attachment to the platform as a source of validation. This mirrors the "haven of safety" that totalist leaders offer, ensuring followers turn to them as their only refuge (Stein 109).

On the flip side, platforms use punishments—such as a lack of engagement, negative feedback, or algorithmic suppression—to instill a sense of unease or exclusion. 
Stein describes how totalist leaders create fear to maintain control because “an essential part of the system involves the constant arousal of fear leading followers 
to turn to the leader or group as the only possible source of rescue and ‘comfort’” (Stein 110). This ensures that followers cannot feel secure outside the group's structure. 
Similarly, social media users often fear missing out (FOMO) or losing visibility, which drives compulsive behavior to regain their standing or repair perceived damage to their social image.

st.header("The Cycle of Dependency")
st.markdown("""
As Stein highlights, the combination of authoritarianism (fear) and charisma (love) creates a disorganized bond between leaders and followers, where individuals 
are both repelled and compelled by the same source (Stein 110). Social media platforms replicate this dynamic. They provide temporary relief through rewards but keep users on edge 
with the threat of exclusion or irrelevance. This cycle ensures users remain glued to the system, continually seeking the comfort of validation while avoiding the discomfort of punishment.

Wang and Zhang expand on this concept, highlighting how social media fosters anxiety through constant comparisons. Young people, in particular, use social media to gauge 
their self-worth by comparing themselves to others, often leading to feelings of inferiority and inadequacy. Drawing on Leon Festinger’s social comparison theory, Wang and Zhang explain 
how individuals measure themselves against those who appear superior or inferior to them, with adolescents being especially vulnerable to this behavior (Wang and Zhang 1462). 
The constant exposure to idealized content intensifies these feelings, perpetuating compulsive use of social media.
