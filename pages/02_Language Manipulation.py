st.title("Language Manipulation and Jargon")

st.markdown("""
Social media platforms utilize language to manipulate group dynamics and foster platform loyalty, employing tactics that parallel those seen in cult environments. 
As Amanda Montell explores in *Cultish: The Language of Fanaticism*, the deliberate use of jargon and language manipulation creates a sense of exclusivity, obscures understanding, 
and reinforces dependency, mirroring cult dynamics in troubling ways.

st.markdown("""
One way language shapes loyalty is through insider jargon. Montell notes that in cults like Scientology, a specialized lexicon is introduced incrementally, starting with simple acronyms 
and abbreviations, such as "ack" for acknowledgment or "cog" for cognition (Montell 134). Similarly, social media platforms use exclusive terms, hashtags, and trends that require users 
to learn and adopt the lingo to feel like part of the in-group. This insider language fosters a sense of superiority and belonging, as users who master the lingo feel involved 
and "cool," much like Cathy’s early experiences with Scientology jargon (Montell 136).

Social media’s version of this "language barrier" serves as a detection system for insiders and outsiders, making users who can’t keep up feel excluded. This tactic encourages conformity 
as users strive to learn the lingo in hopes of gaining social relevance.

st.markdown("""
On Facebook, group loyalty is often reinforced through the use of branded terms like "friend requests," "likes," and "memories." These terms cultivate a sense of belonging and nostalgia, 
tying users emotionally to the platform. Amanda Montell observes that insider jargon, much like Scientology’s acronyms (e.g., SP for Suppressive Person or PTS for Potential Trouble Source), 
fosters a shared understanding that excludes outsiders (Montell 134).

st.markdown("""
Instagram emphasizes visual language alongside textual manipulation. Terms like "tags," "stories," and hashtags such as #OOTD (Outfit of the Day) act “as a detection system to identify 
insiders and outsiders” (Montell 136). Phrases like "Instagram-worthy" or "curated feed" encourage users to craft polished, idealized representations of themselves. This fosters a culture 
of perfectionism, where users compete to align with the platform’s standards.

st.subheader("TikTok")
st.markdown("""
TikTok’s approach to language manipulation is especially dynamic, leveraging its highly actively culture. Insider phrases such as “For You Page” (FYP), “reposts,” and viral trends 
and challenges create a shared identity among users. Montell explains that jargon often serves to disorient outsiders while drawing insiders closer (Montell 137). TikTok thrives on this 
dynamic; its cryptic algorithm and ever-evolving trends leave users to guess what is trendy or relevant. This exclusive language ensures users constantly engage with the 
platform to stay informed and part of the in-group.
