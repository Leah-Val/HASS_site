Social media platforms encourage the creation of pseudopersonalities—new identities formed that are apparent in different environments. 
Margaret Thaler Singer, in *The Brainwashing Controversy* (Chapter 9), explains that pseudopersonalities often emerge in environments of psychological coercion, 
where individuals adopt group-approved behaviors and attitudes to conform. She notes that these "false selves" are adaptive but unstable, fading when individuals 
leave the environment that produced them (Singer 159). On social media, curated profiles operate similarly, reflecting not the authentic self but an idealized 
version presented to extract approval.

In a study on social media addiction published in the journal *Telematics and Informatics* (2021), that explores the connections between social media addiction and
true self, the authors highlight how users engage in self-idealization online. The study involved 490 participants and examined the link between personality traits and social media addiction using surveys. Three key measures were used:
- **Authenticity Scale:** Assessed self-alienation (feeling disconnected from one’s true self), authentic living (acting in line with one’s values), and acceptance of external influence (conforming to others’ expectations).
- **Selfitis Behavior Scale:** Measured problematic behaviors like taking and sharing photos for validation.
- **Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale:** Evaluated addiction through factors like salience, mood modification, and withdrawal (Monacis et al. 4).

The research showed that feeling disconnected and seeking external approval led to idealized self-presentation online, which increased the risk of addiction. On the other hand, being authentic helped protect against these behaviors. 
The study concludes that curating a "false self" for social media can drive addiction, while staying true to yourself can help avoid it (Monacis et al. 6).

Just as Singer notes that pseudopersonalities are reinforced by the group environment and fade when individuals leave, Monacis et al. highlight how these curated identities 
are driven by social media dynamics and can lead to emotional distress when users struggle to reconcile them with their true selves. Both perspectives emphasize how environments 
of intense influence, whether cults or social media, shape temporary, unstable identities that prioritize external approval over authenticity.

st.header("Comparison to Cult Identity Influence")
st.markdown("""
In cult-like systems, people are often pressured to follow group norms, losing their individuality in the process. Singer describes this as the emergence of a "new person" who 
fully embraces the group’s rules and expectations (Singer 158). Social media works in a similar way, rewarding users for conforming to platform-specific trends, aesthetics, 
and behaviors. For example, on Instagram, users carefully curate “perfect” versions of their lives to gain likes, while TikTok trends heavily influence how people express themselves, 
often prioritizing group conformity over individuality.

Singer’s idea of cult environments creating temporary, group-driven identities fits how social media shapes user behavior. The identities users adopt online are tailored to fit 
the latest trends or platform norms, but these are often short-lived. When the trends fade, users can feel disconnected from their authentic selves, left searching for the next way to fit in.
