st.title("Economic Motivations of Social Media Platforms")

st.markdown("""
Social media platforms are not just tools for connection—they are finely tuned systems designed to maximize profits. 
A CEPR article titled *The Economics of Social Media* highlights how platforms operate through content production, 
distribution, and consumption, all with the aim of driving user engagement and generating revenue (Aridor et al., 2024). 
These strategies mirror the manipulative tactics seen in cult-like systems, where psychological influence and control 
are used to serve the organization’s goals rather than the individual’s well-being.

st.markdown("""
Social media platforms depend on user-generated content to thrive. They reward users with likes, comments, and reactions 
to encourage them to produce more content, much like cults reward conformity and participation. The article further explains 
that platforms carefully design features and rules to influence the type of content users create, ensuring it attracts more engagement. 
This endless cycle benefits the platforms, as more engagement means more data and ad revenue.

Amanda Montell’s *Cultish* sheds light on a similar dynamic within MLMs, where participants are conditioned to believe that 
success is guaranteed if they follow the system (Montell 166). Platforms use a comparable strategy by promoting the idea 
that constant posting and engagement lead to success and validation. When users fail to achieve this, they often internalize blame, 
thinking they didn’t try hard enough or weren’t "good enough" at using the platform. This reinforces their dependency and keeps 
them producing content.

st.header("Algorithms and Distribution")
st.markdown("""
Algorithms control how content is distributed, promoting posts that maximize engagement and keeping users locked into their feeds. 
These algorithms are designed to increase time spent on the platform, ensuring users see more ads (Aridor et al. 2024). 

Montell’s observation that MLMs use emotionally manipulative rhetoric to keep people invested also applies here (Montell 167). 
Social media platforms promise the “transcendent experience” of visibility, success, and connection, but these outcomes are rarely 
as attainable as they seem. The carefully crafted rhetoric keeps users coming back, even when their goals remain out of reach.

st.header("User Consumption and Profit")
st.markdown("""
Social media platforms exploit consumption patterns to maximize profit. By creating addictive experiences and fostering habits 
like endless scrolling, they ensure users stay longer, generate more data, and buy products from ads. Montell describes how MLMs sell not just products 
but the promise of community and success that rarely materializes (Montell 167). Social media platforms, like MLMs, profit 
from users' belief in an unattainable ideal, keeping them engaged despite the costs.

st.header("Why It Matters")
st.markdown("""
The parallels between social media platforms and cult-like systems reveal a concerning truth: both prioritize their own growth 
over the well-being of their members. By understanding how platforms manipulate us with rewards, algorithms, and rhetoric, 
we can become more critical of how we engage with them.
